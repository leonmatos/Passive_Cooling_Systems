  review = {Why are instabilities undesired? Because they cause vibrations, alter
	local heat transfer characteristics and, in case nuclear reactors,
	they influence thermal power because of the coupling to neutronics.
	The authors admited a confusion regarding the types of instabilities,
	which can be static or dunamic and a primary or secondary phenomenon.
	The paper then continues and the types are grouped in static and
	dynamic instabilities. Regarding the static types, the authors first
	address what they called fundamental static instability (sec 2.1.1).
	Within this group there is Ledinegg instab. This type occurs when,
	roughly speaking, an increse in mass flow generates a decrese head
	loss, that is, the system curve has negative (descending) slope.
	Within the scope of fundamental instabilities, authors address the
	occurrence of flow excursion in systems with parallel channels. The
	next type is called fundamental relaxation instability (sec 2.1.2).
	This one seems to be related to the transition of flow pattern from
	bubbly flow to annular flow. Next group is compound relaxation instability
	(sec 2.1.3). In this group we find the bumping, geysering and chugging
	processes. In sec 2.2 they start addressing the dynamic instabilities.
	The characteristic that differentiate static from dynamic instabilities
	is the propagation of disturbances in the latter. Theses disturbances
	can be transported by two kinds of waves: acoustic waves or density
	waves. The main characteristic of theses waves is that the former
	presents relatively high frequencies (10-100 Hz), and the latter
	presents low frequencies (with period of oscillations one to two
	times the time required by a fluid particle to travel along the whole
	circuit). Authors comment about very high frequency of acoustic waves
	within audible range (1000-10000 Hz) observed in a supercritical
	loop. The sound produced (which was like a whistle) incresed with
	decreasing inlet temperature and increasing mass flow. Concerning
	DWO, it is mentioned that this subject had been studied along the
	past 15 years (counting backwards from the paper's year) ans is the
	most type of instability encountered in two-phase systems. The paper
	presents comments about the influence of (i) inlet and outlet restrictions
	(where inlet restrictions tend to stabilize the flow and outlet tend
	to destabilize it), (ii) parallel channels, where high by-pass ratios
	destabilizes the flow (in this case, cross connections can make the
	system more stable, and rod bundles are said to be more stable than
	simple parallel sections), (iii) pressure, which is more related
	to two-phase systems, (iv) inlet subcooling, whose effect is said
	to have a minimum value, (v) mass velocity and power, (vi) cosine
	heat flux, (vii) condensing instability. The paper then presents
	the current methods and softwares for stability analysis at that
	time.}

  title = {Nuclear Reactors: Generation to Generation},
  journal = {American Academy of Arts and Sciences},

  review = {This is an article published by the American Society of Arts and Sciences
	which describes the current scenario and perpectives of nuclear power
	expansion in 2011. It also presentes a short review of the generations
	of nuclear power plants. The authors start by mentioning 6 key factors
	that have to be taken into account when analysing deployment of a
	nuclear reactor. Most of these factors are associated or to safety
	aspects of to economics. And the safety aspects are highly related
	to incorporation of passive system in future plant designs. As they
	conclude in the end of the paper, the use of passive safety systems
	is almost an abligatory issue in new nuclear technology. As for the
	economics, the competitiveness of nuclear plants is addressed, and,
	comparing to other technologies for energy generation, authors say
	that “Fossil-fired power, without carbon controls, sets the market
	price today and will likely continue to do so over the next decade.�?
	Another interesting coment about the economic aspects is that new
	technology will need to be convincent and well established in order
	to bring investments. Economics and safety are addressed together
	in the topic of fuel cycle. Regarding the front end, fuel supply
	is the concern, as for the back end, spent fuel disposal is the challenge.
	As for the evolution of nuclear reactor Generations, the only Gen
	I which still operates is Wylfa 1 in Wales (information from PRIS/IAEA
	on 05.09.2014). Gen II represents the bulk of the 437 plants currently
	operating (05.09.2014). Since capital costs of many Gen II power
	plants have been paid off, these reactors generated electricity at
	a cost of approx. 2 cents of dolar per kWh from 2004 to 2011, according
	to the authors. They say that only 4 Gen III plants were in operating
	by the date of this paper. Regarding the Gen III+ reactors, the main
	upgrade with respect to Gen III is the incorporation of passive safety
	systems. Beyond improving the plant's safety, passive systems may
	shorten schedule because it helps in the licencing process. A great
	part of the paper is dedicated to coment the perspectives of Small
	Modular Reactors. According to the authors, this seems to be a promissing
	option for clean energy generation, although there are some doubts
	about its cost-effective characteristic. Gen IV is said to be in
	the level of fundamental scientific development and still require
	two-to-four decades to begin operation. Authors cite a speech of
	pres. Barack Obama in which he says that the nuclear energy will
	be necessary in the expansion of electricity generation in the US,
	and that the reduction of carbon emmission achieved by one nuclear
	power plant can be equivalent to taking 3.5 million cars off the
	road. Last, but not least, the authors estate that “if out-of-the-box
	innovations to the current state of the art in reactor technology
	do not reach the marketplace within the next two dacades�?, then
	required aspects like “safety, fuel cycle, nonproliferation, and
	economic hurdles […] may become burdensome�?.}

  review = {Analysing Ledinegg instability, the authors cite one work concluding
	that this type of instability is only related to thermal-hydraulics
	(independent of the neutronics). As mentioned by Boure1973, they
	say that the use of a throttle valve can avoid Ledinegg instabilities.
	The authors mention another type of static instability, called flow
	pattern transition. DWOs are classified into type I and type II.
	Type I DWO is dominated by gravity effects, and type II DWO is dominated
	by two-phase frictional pressure drop (therefore related to two-phase
	systems). Another type of dynamic instability is parallel channel
	instability. Pressure Drop Oscillations PDOs are also a type of dynamic
	instability, which exhibits long oscillatory period. This instability
	exists only when there are compressible volumes in the loop. The
	author address the coupled neutronic instabilities, and classify
	its feedbacks into thermal-hydraulic feedback due to void regions,
	Doppler reactivity caused feedback and power feedback due to thermal-hydraulics.
	These instabilities can be classified into two types: core wide and
	out-of-phase. The paper then dedicates a section to start up transients,
	and include the Geysering, natural circulation instability and flashing
	into this category. The mathematical models for stability analysis
	are then addressed. The neutronics coupling can be simulated basically
	by two approaches: point neutron kinetics and 3D neutron kinetics.
	For the thermal-hydraulics, the conservation for mass, momentum and
	energy have to be solved (for each phase, in case of boiling loops).
	The most used 1D models for boiling loops are separated flow models
	(two-fluid), drift model and Homogeneous Equilibrium Mixture (HEM).
	Authors say that the drift flux model has the simplicity of HEM models
	and the accuracy of two-fluid models. The choice of the model depends
	on the type of instability to be analysed. As for the numerical codes,
	authors say they can be classified into two groups: frequency domain
	codes and time domain codes. Frequency domain codes (linearization
	of perturbed equations and further Laplace transformation. These
	methods are adequate for analysis of instability inseption and margins.
	The numerical codes can also be classified in Thermal-hydraulics,
	Neutron kinetics and Severe Accident Analysis. Another difference
	between the models is to consider or not thermal equilibrium between
	the phases. To consider thermal equilibrium between the phases is
	a simplification. Linear stability theory applies for the onset of
	instabilities and system behavior after small perturbations around
	a steady state. Linear stab. analysis can be done both in time or
	in frequency domain. But, if perturbations are not so small, non-linear
	phenomena increase in relevance, and linear analysis no longer applies.
	"Therefore, in order to predict the effect of large perturbations
	[...] non-linear dynamic analysis is required". "Non-linear study
	is carried out with reduced order models in ODEs that are derived
	by integrating the governing PDEs along the boiling loop".}

  review = {Authors mention the poor agreement of existent heat transfer correlation
	to experimental data. They also say that there are large uncertainties
	regarding thermo-hydraulics in tight lattice bundles of supercritical
	water reactors. Ledinegg (static) instability: a SMALL variation
	in the flow conditions leads to a COMPLETELY different new steady
	state solution. In DWO (density waver oscillations) there are competing
	solutions for the same problem. The oscillation between different
	solutions is driven by a feedback mechanism (probably within the
	concept of control theory). Authors point the interaction between
	inertia and friction as main feedback mechanism, and say that, for
	nuclear reactors, there is even another feedback: the neutronic one.
	Authors afirm that there is a large amount of numerical works on
	stability of supercritical natural cooling loops. One of them is
	the often cited work of Ambrosini and Sharabi 2008, where, according
	to this paper, the authors employed different numerical techniques
	and, observing an agreement between the results, argued that since
	such different numerical techniques produced similar results, them
	the models should be trustworthy. This paper repeats the conclusion
	presented in another work from Delft group that the distribution
	of friction is more relevant than its average. In the experiments,
	heat is uniformly distributed along reactor channel axis, and it
	is highlighted that future studies with more realistic axial heat
	distribution should be done. They control inflow rate of moderator,
	which impacts on the neutronic feedback. Although this work takes
	neutronic feedback into account, it is only density related feedbak
	(they don't consider temperature feedbak (Doppler effect)). They
	use point kinetics ofr the neutronics. The procedure for filtering
	the frequency signals is described (there is use of a Nyquist theorem).
	Authors studied which measure should be the best for assessing the
	exp. Results. An important conclusion is that, without the neutronic
	feedback, there are no instabilities! The results also showed that
	the large volume of the heat exchanger posed a damping effect to
	the flow. Authors talked about type I and type II instabilities.
	Type I instabilities are driven by gravity effect, and are related
	to low frequencies. It is mentioned that, though the experiments
	weren't able to catch this, there might be a third transition to
	a second unstable region. They also mentioned that an interesting
	finding was that there is a stable path of increasing power and inlet
	temperature: you can increase these parameters without going through
	the unstable zone. A work from Chatoorgoon (2001) is mentioned as
	have presented results dependent on time step and mesh refinement
	(oohhh, scandal, isn't it?). The differences between linear and non-linear
	stability is addressed, citing bifurcation analysis and chaos theory
	as possible methods. I've skipped the section 5 of the paper.}

	introductory text, many fundamental concepts are explained, like

	of instability is important for single-phase. Indeed, differently
